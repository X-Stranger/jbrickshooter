This project written in Java aims to create free implementation of perfect puzzle game named Brick Shooter.

**The project is looking for good soundtrack for JBrickShooter game: short composition to be played in the loop. And it would be nice to add sounds to brick movement and removal. If you have any ideas about that and/or can create small sounds - feel free to mail me to xstranger [at](at.md) gmail.com**

**08/06/2013:** Re-signed jar with private certificate that I've bought. Downloads re-uploaded.

**04/26/2013:** Removed JetBrains and CERTUM logos as soon as they do not provide Open Source licenses for me anymore. Going to buy and sign jar with private certificate.

**12/23/2011:** Packages re-uploaded with jar-file re-signed using new certificate from <a href='https://www.certum.pl/certum/cert,eindex_en.xml'>CERTUM</a> (the previous has been expired). Thanks again for their service!

**11/11/2010:** v1.5.3 released. This release includes fix for bug on 64-bit JVM and game logic change that freezes the 4th brick in the top/left/bottom/right brick collections. Without this freeze you were able to do move/undo several times till you got the color you need. This was tricky and unfair, that is why it was changed. You can also find the game packaged for the latest Ubuntu Maverick. However we will not produce packages for GetDeb.net/PlayDeb.net anymore (sorry guys, but it is not evident how to publish updates, however it looks like you can update your repo by yourself). And special thanks to Holger Hellmuth, who has found the bug with 64-bit JVM, suggested fix for the 4th brick and tested all game variants we've sent him.

**08/23/2010:** v1.5.1 bugfix release. Field filling in Puzzle mode was corrected. Also please note that starting from 1.5.0 your highscore file will be cleared due to new file format.

**08/18/2010:** v1.5.0 released. New "puzzle" game-type is present. It is similar to arcade-type, however has another field filling. Hope this will be interesting for you.

**12/31/2009:** v1.4.1 released. It does not contain serious changes, just small fixes to code for correct work under Java5 and Java Web Start support.

So starting from now the game does not require to be installed: you can play JBrickShooter directly from this page! Just Click on the "Play Now!" button at the page footer and confirm that you trust game publisher. If you have Java correctly configured with your browser then the jar-file will be automatically downloaded and started. Enjoy the game and Happy New Year!
